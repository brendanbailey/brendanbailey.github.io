    "Today I had my computer log into Garnet for me. For those not familiar with Garnet, it is General Assembly’s attendance system, and according to school policy if you are tardy more than five times you cannot receive the additional career support after course has finished. This policy makes complete sense because if General Assembly is building relationships with potential employers, they at minimum need to convey that their students were at least in class. However, I feel bad for those who get to class early and forget to sign in (It’s almost happened to me a couple of times!)."

    "The other reason why I picked this project is that I wanted to explore using Selenium. I did a lot browser automation at my previous job with iMacros. I macros are great for those who have little programming experience because you can just click record, and the program will record every action you do until you click stop. If you play the macro, the system will take the exact steps that you recorded. iMacros also generates a script based on what you recorded, which you can modify according to the task you need to accomplish. However, the free version of iMacros has limited flexibility. For example, you cannot implement conditionals or nested for loops. If you would like to have free reign of what you can do in the browser, and have the time to invest in writing the script then Selenium is a good choice. \n",
