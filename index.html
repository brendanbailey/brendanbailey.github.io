        <br>
        <br>
        <p>A Kaggle Competiton on classifiying cervix types to aid the process of treating cervical cancer.
        We were given over a 1,000 cervix photos, and had to train a model on how to properly identify cervix type based on those photos.
        This competition is important because in areas where they do not have resources to do a pap smear, practitioners need to do a visual inspection, which is dependent on cervix type.
        This project is an exploration of convolutional neural networks, but ultimately a PCA SVM combo was used for the final submission.</p>

          <p>HDBSCAN has the benefits of being able to cluster varying shapes like DBSCAN.
            However, HDBSCAN also performs better on datasets of varying density and is faster with larger datasets.

        <br>
        <p>Garnet is General Assembly's attendance system that students need to sign into everyday at 9am.
          You can only qualify for certain GA benefits if you have a limited number of tardies.
          This policy makes sense, but there is nothing worse than coming in before 9am and forgetting to sign in.
          This Selenium script was developed to help prevent students from getting tardies by automatically signing them into Garnet.</p>

                Brendan is an expert at membership data management. He took a complex problem we presented to him, merging multiple sources of data while maintaining a base file, and combined these disparate sources to create a better membership file for the UAW.
                <br><br>A direct result of Brendan's management of this process was a dramatically increased contact rate with our members during the 2016 cycle. Without Brendan's help this would not be possible, and our program would not have ran as well.
                <br><br>I would recommend Brendan to anyone for management of a complex data issue with a demanding customer, i.e. me! He is great to work with and came up with innovative solutions to our issues. Can't recommend him enough!

                Brendan is an extremely skilled data practitioner versed in Python, SQL, Excel, and more. He was invested in creating infrastructure that would allow for our team to provide scalable services, products, and reports to clients big and small. Brendan wrote scripts that enhanced our productivity, which was an important time saver, solving problems for our team making our work more efficient. These included rapid list clean up and formatting everything from membership data to early vote information reducing hour long projects to minutes.
                <br><br>He used his abilities to not only do the projects that made our team more successful but also to show the team how to harness these skills. He achieved this teaching Python classes for our staff and client staff, helping staff to create macros in order to process repetitive tasks more quickly and coaching others to utilize complex databases and systems he helped to design and build with our IT department. He exercised patience and encouragement during these lessons, helping team members to feel capable and excited about learning high level technical skills often at incredibly busy times.
                <br><br>His main responsibility at the AFL-CIO was managing our multimillion record membership database. This membership data is the core of both our and our clients&#39; campaign operations, and we would not be able to effectively campaign our members without it. He was an excellent project manager working with client IT Departments to acquire their data, vendors to append critical data, and client Political Directors to ensure they were getting the level of service they needed. Brendan also had an excellent eye for detail, catching and working with clients/vendors on errors that came up in this process that would disrupt program. He also worked closely with our IT Department to take a complicated and onerous system for processing this membership information to an efficient, streamlined one. This allowed for a structure that took our work far beyond previous processes, adding valuable information and analysis of lists for our clients to use for their work and understanding of their membership.
                <br><br>Brendan was incredibly dedicated to our organization. His departure was bittersweet, but he made sure to work with a current staff member to bring her up to speed over a two-month training period ensuring his leaving was a smooth process. During this time, he created a repository of documentation for processes and prior work as well as an incredibly well-documented codebase in our git version control system (GitLab) ensuring his historical knowledge while at the AFL-CIO is retained for the future.
                <br><br>Brendan was an incredibly valuable and essential member of our team willing to go above and beyond in his work duties and leaning in any time he was needed. He is not above helping anyone with their work and has a willingness to learn anything he needs to in order to do so.
